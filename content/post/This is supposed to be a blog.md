So I made a blog for the thousandth time and I *intend* to write in it as I *intended* to write in my previous blogs.

And again I do not know what I should write. But at least I have a blog again, and could at least in theory write in it when I come across a suitable idea.

Most of the Ideas that I currently have are more suited for tweets than blog posts. But I donâ€™t even have a proper Tweeter account, so maybe I go and make one and get tired doing it, or maybe I just write them here.
