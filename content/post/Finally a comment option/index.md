After looking for a good commenting plugin, I reached the conclusion that no excellent option exists. I finally chose [giscus](https://giscus.app/).

It is based on **GitHub Discussions**. You need to **authorize** it to access your GitHub account to post a comment under a GitHub Discussion related to the blog post. So no anonymous posting, which is pretty suboptimal.

If you donâ€™t want to authorize *giscus*, you can go to GitHub Discussions and post your comment there yourself. Or you can choose not to comment. Unfortunately, I do not know of any better option that does not require self-hosting and is privacy-friendly too.

*And happy Nowruz, btw.* ðŸ™‚
